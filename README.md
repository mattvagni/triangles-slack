### Local development

- [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). You will need Node version > 8.x
- [Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- Lastly, [install the netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/).

Once you've cloned this repository run `yarn` to install all dependencies.

Then run `netlify dev`

Then, to start the website run `yarn run start`. This will start everything needed for you to view the website locally. It should also automatically open a browser window with the local version of the site running. If not, check the output in your terminal to work out what's going on.

To publish changes, open a pull request on GitHub. Once that's merged your changes will be automatically deployed.
